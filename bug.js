The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a field that does not exist in your database.  For example, if you have a document with a structure like this:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
```

And you try to access the `city` field using the following code:

```javascript
let city = doc.data().city;
```

This will result in an error because the `city` field does not exist.  Instead, you should check for the existence of the field before accessing it:

```javascript
let city = doc.data().city || null;
```

This code will assign `null` to `city` if the field does not exist, preventing an error.
